# 1. Introduction

This project is a graphical To-Do List application developed using Python's `Tkinter` library. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks with options to add, delete, cross out (mark as complete), and uncross (mark as incomplete) tasks. The app features a calm, blue-themed design to enhance user experience and usability.

# 2. Main Objective

- To provide users with a simple yet effective task management tool.

- To help users visually organize and track their daily to-do items.

- To create an intuitive desktop application using Python’s Tkinter module.

# 3. Software and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  

- **GUI Library:** Tkinter (Standard GUI toolkit in Python)  

- **IDE/Editor:** Any Python-compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)  

- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

# 4. System Design

The system consists of the following components:

- **Input Field (Entry):** Allows users to type in a task.

- **Buttons:**  
  - Add Task  
  - Delete Task  
  - Cross Out (mark as completed)  
  - Uncross (mark as incomplete)  

- **Task List (Listbox):** Displays all current tasks.

- **Fonts & Colors:** Two fonts used to differentiate between active and completed tasks. A soft blue color theme enhances the visual interface.

# 5. Functionalities Implemented

- ✅ Add new tasks to the list  

- ❌ Delete selected tasks  

- ✔️ Cross out tasks with a check mark and strikethrough style  

- 🔁 Uncross tasks to return them to active status  

- 📛 Error handling with alert dialogs for empty input or invalid selections

# 6. Workflow

. User enters a task in the input field.

. Presses "Add Task" to insert the task into the list.

. Selects a task and chooses:
   - "Cross Out" to mark it complete
   - "Uncross" to revert it back to active
   - "Delete Task" to remove it

. All actions immediately reflect in the GUI.

# 8. Advantages

- ✅ Easy to use with clean GUI  

- ✅ Lightweight and platform-independent  

- ✅ Immediate visual feedback for completed tasks  

- ✅ Helpful error messages to guide users  

- ✅ No external dependencies — uses standard Python libraries

# 9. Limitations

- ❌ No persistent storage (tasks are lost after closing the app)  

- ❌ Cannot edit existing tasks  

- ❌ No sorting or filtering options  

- ❌ Only one task can be selected at a time

# 10. Future Enhancements

- 💾 Add save/load functionality using files or a database  

- 🖊️ Implement task editing  

- 🔍 Add search/filtering features  

- 📅 Include due dates and priorities  

- 💡 Enable drag-and-drop for task reordering  

- ⌨️ Add keyboard shortcuts for faster operation

# 11. Conclusion

This Tkinter-based To-Do List app serves as a practical and beginner-friendly project for understanding GUI development in Python. While simple, it effectively demonstrates interactive UI features and basic event handling, and can be extended for more complex task management needs.
